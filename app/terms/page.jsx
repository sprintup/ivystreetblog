      <p>
        Welcome to IvyStreet.blog (the "Website"). By accessing or using the
        Website, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If
        you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Website.
      </p>

      <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2'>Use of the Website</h2>
      <p>
        The Website is intended for users of all ages, with a focus on providing
        content and services related to children's books. You agree to use the
        Website only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.
        Parents and guardians are responsible for monitoring the books their
        children read.
      </p>

      <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2'>Open Source</h2>
      <p>
        The code for this Website is open source, and you are free to copy,
        modify, and distribute the code in accordance with the applicable
        open-source license.
      </p>

      <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-2'>User-Generated Content</h2>
      <p>
        The Website may allow users to share book lists, reviews, and
        recommendations. By submitting content to the Website, you grant
        IvyStreet.blog a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable,
        and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish,
        translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such
        content throughout the world in any media. There should be no personally
        identifiable information included in any of the user-generated content,
        such as names, emails, or phone numbers. The website is designed so the
        user can set a secret public profile name that only they know who it
        belongs to. Then they can share this profile name, which is used to
        display the book lists the user has made publicly available. They can
        change the profile name at any time and set book lists to private at any
        time. However, once another user adds a book they find in a book list to
        their own reading list, the owner of the book and its related
        information cannot make it private, but they can delete the book to make
        it not available.
      </p>

        These links are provided for your convenience only. IvyStreet.blog has
        no control over the content of those websites and is not responsible for

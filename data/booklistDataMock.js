    title: "Children's Book Set Project - Mid-Point Draft",
    description:
      "The theme of this booklist is emotional development, which is a cornerstone to prosocial development. I selected these titles for messages they have about emotions. I was inspired to produce this list because of a class I took, Infant and Toddler development, where I learned that infants and toddlers who practice empathy are more likely to have better pro social outcomes. Further, learning how to communicate emotions leads to better behavioral outcomes as well. These are books that I think help children understand and communicate their emotions so that when they're frustrated, they have more tools available than simply physical outbursts.\n\n I'm creating this project for my son as well as children in the neighborhood. We live close to a school that has had some challenges recently with behavior and leadership. I have a little free library that I hope to attach a link using a QR code and visible link to the website, where kids in the neighborhood can curate booklists to share with one another. The hope is they will curate booklists that they like (module 1 - a good book is a combination of literary quality and reader's preferences) and share them with others, allowing others to understand them a little better based on the perspectives presented in the books.\n\n",

          "Blue is a quiet color. Red’s a hothead who likes to pick on Blue. Yellow, Orange, Green, and Purple don’t like what they see, but what can they do? When no one speaks up, things get out of hand — until One comes along and shows all the colors how to stand up, stand together, and count. As budding young readers learn about numbers, counting, and primary and secondary colors, they also learn about accepting each other's differences and how it sometimes just takes one voice to make everyone count.",
